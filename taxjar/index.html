        Hey there TaxJar! I am a Rails Engineer with 3+ years of experience based out of Seattle.

      <h2>a little bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working with Rails for a little over 3 years now. Most of my
        experience has been spent working on Procore - a construction project
        management solution. Its a pretty huge app (500+ models) and I've
        touched just about every piece. So I'm very comfortable with the entire
        stack. I'm usually jumping between some of the backend services and the
        front end (a hybrid of Rails / React JS). 
      </p>

      <h2>why taxjar</h2>
      <p>
        I love "real businesses" - companies which make awesome products their
        customers value so much they happily pay month after month. No acquire
        critical mass games before figuring out how to become profitable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Where do I fit in? I've got the experience you're looking for. I am a
        Rails engineer who is very comfortable with the front end. I write
        clean, well tested code. I value performance and spend a lot of time
        digging into issues at both the database and view level. I have
        designed UIs for products used by hundreds of thousands of users.

      <h2>some of my recent work</h2>
      <p>
        Hereâ€™s a few screenshots from some of my recent work. They cover both
        backend and frontend work.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Service for Scanning in Construction Drawings
      </h3>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="/taxjar/images/OCR-Results.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Clients upload their construction set pdf (usually a few hundred pages
        and a few gigs in size), then this service splits it apart into
        individual sheets. To make data entry way easier we used OCR to pull out
        the text from each sheet and then do some fancy filtering to pull out
        useful metadata like the drawing name and number. You can see the
        auto-filled inputs in the screenshot.
      </p>

      <h3>
        JavaScript Based Markup Editor
      </h3>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="/taxjar/images/Markup-Editor.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        A markup editor that allows construction professionals the ability to add
        markups to their construction drawings. Users can draw clouds, arrows,
        add text and create links to other sheets. Everything is synced to both
        web and mobile apps.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Documentation Site

      </div>
      <p>
        I got tired of an out of date and not very pretty wiki. So I
        created a middleman application to replace it.  Easy to update - each
        page has a quick link to the Github editor. On commit, the application
        rebuilds and updates itself automatically so edits can be viewed
        almost as soon as they are published.

      <h2>a little bit <strong>more</strong> about me</h2>
      <p>
        I've just recently started getting publicly active on Github - let me
        show you some of the highlights.
      </p>

          <a href="https://github.com/radar/paranoia/pull/189" target="_blank">
          My latest open pull request</a> - while upgrading
          an application from Rails 3.x to 4.x I ran into an issue with the
          Paranoia Gem.

          information from all of the services a developer might use (Github,
          Trello, etc) and present a nice dashboard of whats on your plate for
          the day.

        Some other interesting tidbits. The only thing I love more than Vim or
        donuts are animated Gifs. I'm quite surprised none have actually made it
        into the page by now. In my spare time I tinker with things. Coolest
        thing I ever tinkered with was probably my uncle's 1973 911. We spent a
        summer tearing out the engine and replacing it with an electric one.

      <p>
        In case you were wondering, here are the top 3 decisions I've made in
        my life:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Buying a beat up Volkwagon GTI</li>
        <li>Getting that <a href="http://www.cucasrestaurant.com/index.cfm", target="_blank">California Burrito</a> with Shrimp</li>
        <li>Purchasing work slippers</li>
