      <h2>a little bit about me</h2>
      <p>
        I've been working with Rails for a little over 3 years now. Most of my
        experience has been spent working on Procore - a construction project
        management solution. Its a pretty huge app (500+ models) and I've
        touched just about every piece. So I'm very comfortable with the entire
        stack. I'm usually jumping between some of the backend services and the
        front end (a hybrid of Rails / React JS). 
      </p>

      <h2>why harvest</h2>
      <p>
        I love "real businesses" - companies that make awesome products which
        customers value so much they happily purchase. No acquire critical mass
        games before figuring out how to become profitable. I admire that you
        folks at Harvest have managed to create a business that is
        self-sustaining. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Reading through your engineering blog I can see that we share similar
        beliefs about code. Clear, well tested and quality code is valued. You
        seem to have high cohesion between various departments - engineering,
        product, design all come together to make a great product. I love this quote
        about empowerment from one of the blog posts:

        <blockquote>
          I’ve worked in some places where the unspoken rule was “It ain’t
          broken enough, so don’t fix it” and that is not the case at Harvest.
          Most of us have our own personal short list of areas we want to make
          better and have the flexibility to squeeze wins here and there within
          a normal work week.
        </blockquote>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is awesome. There is nothing more demoralizing than staring at
        code you know could be so much better and being told you're not allowed
        to fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, also I love using <em>Chosen</em> - big fan of the open source
        contributions
      </p>

      <p>
        So where do I fit in? I've got the experience you're looking for. I
        have helped move a legacy codebase that started at Rails 1.x (was on
        2.x when I joined) to 4.x. I write clean, well tested code. I value
        performance and spend a lot of time digging into issues at both the
        database and view level. I enjoy working on the full-stack - and I'd
        like to think I've got a good a taste for design.

      <h2>some of my recent work</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s a few screenshots from some of my recent work. They cover both
        backend and frontend work.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Service for Scanning in Construction Drawings
      </h3>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="/harvest/images/OCR-Results.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Clients upload their construction set pdf (usually a few hundred pages
        and a few gigs in size), then this service splits it apart into
        individual sheets. To make data entry way easier we used OCR to pull out
        the text from each sheet and then do some fancy filtering to pull out
        useful metadata like the drawing name and number. You can see the
        auto-filled inputs in the screenshot.
      </p>

      <h3>
        JavaScript Based Markup Editor
      </h3>
      <div class="image-holder">
        <img src="/harvest/images/Markup-Editor.jpg" />
      </div>
      <p>
        A markup editor that allows construction professionals the ability to add
        markups to their construction drawings. Users can draw clouds, arrows,
        add text and create links to other sheets. Everything is synced to both
        web and mobile apps.
      </p>

      </div>
      <p>
        I got tired of an out of date and not very pretty wiki. So I
        created a middleman application to replace it.  Easy to update - each
        page has a quick link to the Github editor. On commit, the application
        rebuilds and updates itself automatically so edits can be viewed
        almost as soon as they are published.

      <h2>a little bit <strong>more</strong> about me</h2>
      <p>
        I've just recently started getting publicly active on Github - let me
        show you some of the highlights.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://patkoperwas.github.io/" target="_blank">My Blog</a> -
          where I write technical things.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/radar/paranoia/pull/189" target="_blank">
          My latest open pull request</a> - while upgrading
          an application from Rails 3.x to 4.x I ran into an issue with the
          Paranoia Gem.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/devlocker" target="_blank">DevLocker</a> - project I'm starting. It's supposed pull
          information from all of the services a developer might use (Github,
          Trello, etc) and present a nice dashboard of whats on your plate for
          the day.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Some other interesting tidbits. The only thing I love more than Vim or
        donuts are animated Gifs. I'm quite surprised none have actually made it
        into the page by now. In my spare time I tinker with things. Coolest
        thing I ever tinkered with was probably my uncle's 1973 911. We spent a
        summer tearing out the engine and replacing it with an electric one.
      </p>

      <p>
        In case you were wondering, here are the top 3 decisions I've made in
        my life:

        <li>Buying a beat up Volkwagon GTI</li>
        <li>Getting that <a href="http://www.cucasrestaurant.com/index.cfm", target="_blank">California Burrito</a> with Shrimp</li>

      <h2><strong>strong</strong> parameters</h2>
      <p>
        Rails 4 makes <strong>strong</strong> parameters the default option for
        mass-assignment protection. It does away with some of the problems of the
        older <em>attr_protected</em> and <em>attr_accessible</em> which have now
        been removed. One of the main drawbacks of the older ways was that it
        became difficult and cumbersome to specify levels of accessibility. An
        admin may have different write privileges than a normal user. Or if you
        were building a multi-step wizard certain steps would or would not be
        allowed to modify model data.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using <em>attr_accessible</em> we also introduce a hidden logic into
        our models. What it says is that if this hash has this particular key,
        assign it, else throw an error.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strong parameters moves that logic out of the model and closer to where
        the data is coming from - the controller. Strong parameters allows us
        to whitelist permitted parameters easily. We can have different sets of
        permitted params depending on the state of the application or the
        currently signed in user.
      </p>

      <p>
        Strong parameters is also flexible enough to be used outside of
        controllers. Any place that I might get model attributes I can filter
        them out to ensure I do not open myself up to a mass-assignment
        vulnerability. This could be JSON that I get from a third-party API or
        another gem.
